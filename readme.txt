== Description ==

Ninja Forms Modal makes it super easy to open any Ninja Form in a pop up modal from a text or image link. This plugin requires [Ninja Forms](http://ninjaforms.com) to function.

Simply use the [ninja_forms_modal] shortcode and pass it the following parameters: your form ID (id), the text or image url you would like to be used as the link to your Ninja Forms Modal (text_link, image_link).

Here is a example of a text link: [ninja_forms_modal_form id=2 text_link="Click here to fill out out form"]

Here is a example of a text link: [ninja_forms_modal_form id=2 image_link="http://yourdomain.com/img/yourimage.png"]

Now when anyone click that link your Ninja Forms will open in a very nice modal window. Coming soon we will be adding style definitions for the modal window to the Ninja Forms Layout & Styles Extension.

Ninja Forms Modal uses jQuery Modal which is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
